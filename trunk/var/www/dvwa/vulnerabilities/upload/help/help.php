<h1>Help - File Upload</h1>

<p>Image upload scripts can be vulnerable if they do not check and restrict file extentions. A PHP file could be uploaded to the server and then executed through the URL. The files are uploaded to http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/hackable/uploads/</p>
<p>Another thing worth looking for are restrictions within 'hidden' form fields.</p>
