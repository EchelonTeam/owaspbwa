= User Accounts =

The various vulnerable web applications have some user accounts created and some content included.  See [ApplicationAccounts] for details.

= Management =

Once booted, the VM can be administered few a few different mechanisms. Note, I don't consider these components "in scope" for the vulnerabilities in the VM... they are just there to support management.  Administrative interfaces:
  * SSH
  * Samba shares
  * Console login
  * PHPMyAdmin (at `http://ip/phpmyadmin`)
  * Tomcat Manager (at `http://ip:8080/manager/html`)

*In all cases, use a username of "root" and a password of "owaspbwa".*

= Vulnerabilities =

I don't have a catalog of all the vulnerabilities contained in the VM.  My plan is to track those here on Google Code as "Issues" with the label "Known-Vulnerability" and with a status of SubmittedKV and VerifiedKV. 

Please review the [http://code.google.com/p/owaspbwa/issues/list Issues Page] to see what people have already reported and feel free to submit some additional items for everyone's benefit.
