= Download = 

See the [Downloads downloads page] for information about where to get the VM.

= User Accounts =

The various vulnerable web applications have some user accounts created and some content included.  See [ApplicationAccounts] for details.

= Management =

Once booted, the VM can be administered few a few different mechanisms. Note, I don't consider these components "in scope" for the vulnerabilities in the VM... they are just there to support management.  Administrative interfaces:
  * SSH
  * Samba shares
  * Console login
  * PHPMyAdmin (at `http://owaspbwa/phpmyadmin`)
  * Tomcat Manager (at `http://owaspbwa:8080/manager/html`)

*In all cases, use a username of "root" and a password of "owaspbwa".*

= Vulnerabilities =

The known security vulnerabilities in the applications are tracked at http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/owaspbwa/report/1. Please submit any additional issues that you discover. 

= Known Bugs = 

All known bugs (not the intentional security issues) in the VM are in the issue tracker (see "Issues" in the menu bar above). Please report any additional bugs you discover.
