= Management =

Once booted, the VM can be administered few a few different mechanisms.  In all cases, use a username of "root" and a password of "owaspbwa".  Note, I don't consider these components "in scope" for the vulnerabilities in the VM... they are just there to support management.  Administrative interfaces:
  * SSH
  * Samba shares
  * Console login
  * PHPMyAdmin (at !http://ip/phpmyadmin)
  * Tomcat Manager (at !http://ip:8080/manager)
