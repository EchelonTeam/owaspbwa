= Getting Started =

== Virtual Machine Format ==

The OWASP BWA VM is distributed in VMware virtual machine and virtual disk format.  It has been specifically configured to work with their no cost (Player and X) and older products (in addition to their newer, commercial offerings).

See [#Converting_Virtual_Machine_Format Converting Virtual Machine Format] if you want to use the VM with other virtualization software.

== Usernames and Passwords ==

In general, applications on OWASP BWA have been configured with an administrative account named 'admin' with a password of 'admin' and a "normal" user account named 'user' with a password of 'user'.  In some cases, however, this was not possible or additional accounts were required.

The full list of credentials for each application can be found on the main OWASP BWA web page (in the VM).  In order to view the credentials for each application, click the green plus next to the application name on that we page to show more information about the application.
