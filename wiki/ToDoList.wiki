#summary Things to do on the project

= To Do List=

Things to do before the 1.0 release at [http://www.appsecdc.org OWASP AppSec DC Conference] in November 2009:
  * Fix / delete applications that are still not working
     * Flash applications
     * !PersonalBlog
     * Others?
     * Squirrelmail
  * Delete struts hello world application (unless it is needed)
  * Create CSRF-able version of the CSRFGuard test app (disable guard)
  * Finish Mandiant struts forms
  * Finalize default.html page(s) for Tomcat and Apache servers
  * Finish documenting user accounts for various applications.
  * Finish script to delete logs, etc before publishing VM (and run it).  Script should likely:
     * Delete all files under /var/log (but not any directories)
     * Delete the bash histories for root and user
     * Delete all files and directories in /tmp
     * Maybe clean some other things from user and root home directories (especially . directories)
     * Other things?
  * Find place to host VM for conference (ideally via !BitTorrent)
  * Create a little readme.txt file to put in the VM's .zip file.
  * Burn a few CDs to hand out at the conference (probably will need to .7z the VM in order to fit on one CD, but even that may not work with the final VM)
