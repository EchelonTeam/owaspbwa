#summary Things to do on the project

Below is a list of items that we would like to accomplish for the 1.0 release.

   * Add a Flash application using AMF messages
   * Add more Java applications, esp. ones using Struts or Spring if possible
   * Add some non-trivial ASP.NET applications (a bit hard since so many of those require a MS SQL database)
   * Add Google's Gruyere (if we can get approval from them to modify it as needed to run on the VM)
