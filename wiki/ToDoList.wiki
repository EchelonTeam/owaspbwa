= To Do List=

Things to do before the 1.0 release at [http://www.appsecdc.org OWASP AppSec DC Conference] in November 2009:
  * Fix / delete applications that are still not working
     * Flash applications
     * !PersonalBlog
     * Others?
  * Delete struts hello world application (unless it is needed)
  * Create CSRF-able version of the CSRFGuard test app (disable guard)
  * Finish Mandiant struts forms
  * Create default.html page(s) for Tomcat and Apache servers
  * Document user accounts for various applications.
  * Create script to delete logs, etc before publishing VM (and run it).  Script should likely:
     * Delete all files under /var/log (but not any directories)
     * Delete the bash histories for root and user
     * Other things?
  * Find place to host VM for conference (ideally via !BitTorrent)
