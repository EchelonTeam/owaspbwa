Version 0.94 of the OWASP Broken Web Applications Virtual Machine (VM) was released on July 24, 2011.

The VM is in [http://www.vmware.com VMware] format compatible with their no-cost [http://www.vmware.com/products/player/ VMware Player] and [http://www.vmware.com/products/server/ VMware Server] products (along with their commercial products).  

The VM can be downloaded as a .zip file or as a much smaller [http://www.7-zip.org/ .7z 7-zip Archive].  *BOTH FILES CONTAIN THE EXACT SAME VM!*  I recommend that you download the .7z archive if possible to save bandwidth (and time). 7-zip IS [http://www.7-zip.org/download.html available for Mac, Linux, and other Operating Systems].

Download from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/].

= Installation =

The VM requires no installation.  Simply extract the files from the archive and then start the VM in a VMware product.  Once the machine is booted, you can access it via the console, SSH, or Samba using username=root and password=owaspbwa.

Note - The VM is entirely command line driven.  X-Windows or other GUI systems have not been installed.

If you would like to access your VM from links off this site, the one configuration change you may need to make is to add an entry to your hosts file pointing to the name owaspbwa to the IP address of your VM.  It is recommended that you do this so that you can follow links on this web site to pages on your local OWASPBWA VM.
