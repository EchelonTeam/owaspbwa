= Installation =

The VM requires no installation.  Simply extract the files from the archive and then start the VM in a VMware product.  Once the machine is booted, you can access it via the console, SSH, or Samba using username=root and password=owaspbwa.

Note - The VM is entirely command line driven.  X-Windows or other GUI systems have not been installed.

If you would like to access your VM from links off this site, the one configuration change you may need to make is to add an entry to your hosts file pointing to the name owaspbwa to the IP address of your VM.
